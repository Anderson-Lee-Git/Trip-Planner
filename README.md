# Trip Planner
> A web application to plan group trips and handle cost management during the trip
## Features 
1. Plan events ahead with accessible user-interface
2. Manage everyone's cost to prevent you from worrying about who owes you money after the trip
## Note for development
### Backend
This project is still under construction. For the back-end, there are more design decisions including using better framework rather than pure http server in Python. The documentation can follow REST API guideline for clearity. We can also potentially import database system to store all information. 
### Frontend 
On the right track to divide components and make information flexible constant.
### Connection
The bridge between the server and frontend has been tested. The format is undecided and it's possible to change it because of using new framework for backend.
### Features for the future
1. Login system
2. Calendar view
3. Google map for geographic information
